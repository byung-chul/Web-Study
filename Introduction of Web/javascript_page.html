            JavaScript
        </a>
        often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification. JavaScript is
        high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm. It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing,
        prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.

        Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web. Over 97% of
        websites use it client-side for web page behavior, often incorporating third-party libraries. Most web
        browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on the user's device.
    </p>
    <p>
        As a multi-paradigm language, JavaScript supports event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles.
        It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard
        data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).
    </p>
    <p>
        The ECMAScript standard does not include any input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage, or graphics
        facilities. In practice, the web browser or other runtime system provides JavaScript APIs for I/O.
    </p>
    <p>
        JavaScript engines were originally used only in web browsers, but they are now core components of other software
        systems, most notably servers and a variety of applications.
    </p>
    <p>
        Although there are similarities between JavaScript and Java, including language name, syntax, and respective
        standard libraries, the two languages are distinct and differ greatly in design.
